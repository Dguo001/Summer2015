This uses the ultrasound sensor and the buttons on the joystick to control the claws. 
  Button one puts the claws full down
  Button two raises them 17 inches 
  (17in - 43.18cm - is my imaginary height of one tote)
  (1m is my imaginary height for the total range of the claws)

//moves the motors down half speed until the claws are a meter away, aka full down
if the button input = 1
{
  while the ultrasonic sensor < 770 (1 meter distance)
  {
    move the motors -.5 (half speed)
    }
}

//moves motor until value of ultrasonic sensor is 17 inches higher than start
if the button input = 2
{
  take the value of the ultrasonic sensor at that point and set it to "a"
  while the ultrasonic sensor < a - 344
  {
    move the motor .5 (up half speed)
    }
  }
